## Flows

- **Adding to cart** `flows-adding-to-cart.md` — Shopping online means users need to easily add products they want to their cart. This fundamental action can make or break a sale, so getting it right is crucial.
- **Uploading media** `flows-uploading-media.md`
- **Verifying account** `flows-verifying-account.md` — Verification is a critical role to promise security for a user in the early phases of onboarding, which means it must be a smooth experience that feels helps rather than burdensome.
- **Canceling subscription** `flows-canceling-subscription.md` — Similar to closing an account, a user can decide to end their experience and stop paying for your product. Just because they're leaving doesn't mean we can't give them a graceful exit. It's important to make a cancelation obvious to find and easy to travel through.
- **Filtering items** `flows-filtering-items.md` — Filtering helps users find what they need in large collections by specifying specific values of properties the items contain.
- **Saving changes** `flows-saving-changes.md` — Users are constantly updating their details. They might be changing an email address, fixing a typo in their name, or updating their payment details. That's why it's important to confirm that a change has been saved, in the clearest way. Here's a breakdown of how changes being saved should look and feel like.
- **Entering promo code** `flows-entering-promo-code.md` — A reward for a user to earn a discount on their purchase, promo codes are a pre-requisite in any e-commerce website. ‍ To avoid a confused customer, make sure they understand what is happening with their code - whether it works, expired or isn't applicable.
- **Showing input error** `flows-showing-input-error.md` — Users mistype all the time - whether it's a finger slipping or rushing through letters, errors happen. So for an everyday occurrence, solving an error should be obvious and seamless. The key parts of making that happen are strong visuals, clear communication, and state changes — which are all featured below.
- **Resetting password** `flows-resetting-password.md` — Every now and then, a user can't remember their password to log back in. Luckily, it's a straightforward process to change it. It's important to make the experience feel straightforward, so the user feels like they've gotten back into their account as smooth as possible.
- **Deleting account** `flows-deleting-account.md` — Sometimes it's just not meant to be, and that's okay. Users come and go, so it's important to recognise your solution is only for some and not for all. For those who want to leave, make it as simple as possible. You can try to understand why they're leaving, but don't get too in the way. ‍ There's no need to be passive aggressive or guilt tripping. They'll remember it, and likely share the experience with others who will reconsider your product.
- **Contacting support** `flows-contacting-support.md` — If there's ever a problem, a user should know how to get help. Then when they try to get that help, they should know exactly what kind of communication they're receiving. Making support not only available but suitable to how users tackle a problem is important on being on the right track together. If you're explaining to a user in text where the interface elements are when a screenshot would tell a much clearer story, then that's the first problem to solve before you even get to theirs.
- **Making a card payment** `flows-making-a-payment.md` — When paying for something online, two thoughts will come to mind for the user: is this safe, and is this clear? A well-designed payment experience covers these by communicating what's happening with a user's money, and that it's all happening securely. Below are the steps a user will take to submit a card payment, and what factors you'll need to consider.
- **Submitting a form** `flows-submitting-a-form.md` — A form can help a user achieve anything from creating an account to subscribing to a newsletter. They are often the last step of a user's journey, so should be quick and easy to complete.
